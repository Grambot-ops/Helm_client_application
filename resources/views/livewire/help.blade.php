                    Understanding the states of a competition can initially be confusing, but with a clear explanation, they become quite intuitive. For a general participant, there are four main states to be aware of. Before the competition starts, a green lock icon with the text "open" indicates that users can apply to participate. This is the most basic state. Once the competition begins, marked by the passing of its start date, the state changes to a blue upload icon with the text "upload," signifying that submissions can now be uploaded until the submission deadline.

                    After the submission date, the competition enters one of two possible states. If the winner is to be chosen by vote, a "votes open" status will appear, allowing users to vote for their favorite submissions while the ranking is visible. Alternatively, if the competition is judged by the organizer and winners have not yet been chosen, an orange "pending winners" status will be displayed. The final state is the "closed" state, which indicates that voting is finished and the final winners are visible in the ranking.

                    Once a competition enters its voting stage, you can cast your vote for the best submissions. To vote, simply click the vote button on the dashboard or the "See More Info" page. You can vote for as many submissions as the organizer has allowed. If a participant has multiple entries, make sure to vote for their best one. To view the competition rankings, click the "Ranking" button on either the "See More Info" page or the vote page.                </p>

                    If you applied for a competition before it started and it is now running, you can make a submission. A blue "Submit" button will appear on both the dashboard and the "See More Info" page. Click this button and follow the form provided to submit your entry. Make sure to present your submission well with a good title, an attractive picture, and a detailed description. Depending on the organizer's settings, you may also need to upload a link or a file. You can view your own submissions by clicking the "View Own Submissions" button on the "See More Info" page, where you can also review and delete your entries if needed.                </p>

                    Feel like organizing your own competition? That's amazing! Your contributions keep the platform vibrant. Let's guide you through the steps. On the dashboard, you'll find a "Propose Competition" button, which will take you to the proposal page. Here, you can fill in all the details of your competition. Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk (*). Make sure to complete the form thoroughly, as an administrator will need to review your proposal. The competition can either be accepted or denied based on this review.                </p>
                <br>

                    If your well-thought-out competition is accepted by the admin, it will be visible to users on the dashboard. As an organizer, you can edit the competition dates by clicking the "Manage Competition" button on the "See More Info" page. Additionally, you can send announcements to all users enrolled in your competition via the "Send Announcement" button.

                    An important aspect to consider is setting the number of submissions allowed per participant and determining how the winner will be chosen. You can choose to select the winner yourself or allow the public to vote. If you opt for public voting, you can set the number of votes each person has. If you decide to select the winner yourself, a status message "Determine Winners" will be displayed once you are able to pick a winner. By navigating to the "See More Info" page, you can click the "Determine Winners" button to select the top three winners of the competition.                </p>
